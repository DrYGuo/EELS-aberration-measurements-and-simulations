# EELS-aberration-measurements-and-simulations
Measurements and corrections of the aberrations in the electron energy loss spectrometer of a monochromated STEM is a critical to improving the energy resolution of electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). Here, two codes have been developed: one is for simulating the EELS aberration patterns using the NION's convention; the other code is for automatic data collection for generating the EELS aberration patterns. There is some overlap between the latter program and the EELS Tuning program developed by NION (where the geometric aberration can be measured and corrected) but some new functionalities are added, which might enable the measurements of chromatic aberration at the same time. The simulation code for EELS aberration patterns is adapted from Hamish Brown's pymultislice code https://github.com/HamishGBrown/py_multislice. It enables the simulation of the EELS aberration patterns at any convergence angle and simulation of beam motion on EELS camera in ray tracing experiments. Both programs are still under development.
